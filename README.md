# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project---Human-Activity-Data
This data project involved collecting exercise metrics of two groups of people (test and training) doing one of six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying). Below is a description of the data files that were used in this project.

The trainingdatax and testdatax files contained the raw exercise data from the training group and the test group, respectively. The trainingdatay and testsdatay files contained information regarding the specific activity that the training and test data individuals were doing, labeled with a number.
